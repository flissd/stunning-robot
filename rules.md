# X-Team 33 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We could do a voltuneer system to do each task, if no one wants a specefic job do rock paper scissors.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Create deadlines for each task someone is responsibe for. Give updates on your progress in the group chat.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Let the group know via the group chat you're having problems. Figure out a time we can get together with some or all of the group and
figure out the issue.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We can switch the tasks with someone or if any method is hard/long then we can work on it together


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
